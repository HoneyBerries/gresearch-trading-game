# Trading Game Client

## Setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd gr_tradinggame_client
uv sync
```

## Usage

### 1. Edit `solution.py`

Write your strategy in the `play` function or class method:

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []

    def play(self, reward: float, lockout: int, t: int, T: int, your_score: float, other_scores: list[tuple[float, bool]], is_locked: bool = False) -> bool:
        self.history.append(reward)
        if is_locked:
            return False
        return reward > 14.0

play = Solution().play
```

Your function is called every round (including while locked out). Returning `True` while locked out has no effect but you still observe the reward and the state of the game.

### 2. Test locally

```bash
uv run python test.py
```

Checks your function handles edge cases and runs fast enough.

### 3. Submit

Edit `config.py` with your team name, password, and server address, then:

```bash
uv run python submit.py
```

You can resubmit as many times as you want. The server uses your latest submission.

### Password

Your password is set on your first submission. All future submissions for that team name must use the same password. Choose anything you like, just don't forget it.
